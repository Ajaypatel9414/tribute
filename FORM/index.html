      <p>Akira Toriyama was born in <span>Kiyosu, Japan</span>. He was a <span>Japanese manga artist</span> and <span>character designer</span>. He studied design at a technology and engineering high school in Aichi Prefecture. After graduating, he worked as a designer for an advertising company in Nagoya.

        He left his job after a few years and started drawing manga at 23. His first manga, an action and adventure comic called <span>“Wonder Island”</span> was published in 1978.
        He gained popularity with the serialization of <span>“Dr. Slump”</span> from <span>1980 to 1984</span>, a science-fiction manga about an android girl known for her childlike personality and superhuman strength. It was adapted for television as an <span>anime series</span>.
        Mr. Toriyama's absurd concepts and sense of <span>caricature</span> “sparked a real joyful hysteria” in Japan, Matthieu Pinon and Laurent Lefebvre wrote in <span>“A History of Modern Manga”</span> (2023).
        Throughout his career, Mr. Toriyama did not care if his work did anything besides entertaining its readers, he said in a 2013 interview with the Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun. He was, he suggested, unlike “other manga artists concerned about conveying didactic messages.”

        “The role of my manga,” he said, “is to be a work of entertainment through and through.”
        When <span>“Dragon Ball”</span> was first published in <span>1984</span>, it was an immediate hit, becoming one of the <span>best-selling manga series</span> of all time. It sold more than <span>260 million copies</span> worldwide, according to <span>Toei Animation</span>, the studio that produced the anime adaptation.
         He <span>died</span> at the age of 68 on <span>march 1, 2024</span> due to <span>acute subdural hematoma</span>.
